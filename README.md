### CS-310 Jukebox Playlist Application
This project represents the collaborative development between myself, Sarah Deleppo, and fellow classmates of CS-310. In this project, my peers and I developed a Jukebox Playlist application which incorporates each of our favorite songs and artists into individual playlists for each member of the course. In addition to learning invaluable collaboration techniques this project aided me in gaining a deeper comfort level for consuming other developersâ€™ code, teaching me how to better understand, adapt, and improve my own development skills.
